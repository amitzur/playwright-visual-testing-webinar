                    <h2 className={articleH2}>Why Sleep Is Essential</h2>
                    <h3 className={articleH3}>Physical Health</h3>
                    <p className={articleP}>
                        Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining physical health. During sleep, the body undergoes processes that repair tissues, build muscle, and strengthen the immune system. A lack of sleep has been linked to various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Furthermore, sleep is essential for regulating hormones that control hunger and stress, making it a key factor in overall wellness.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className={articleH3}>Mental Health</h3>
                    <p className={articleP}>
                        In addition to its physical benefits, sleep is vital for mental health. It helps regulate mood, improve cognitive function, and enhance memory. When we don’t get enough sleep, we’re more likely to experience irritability, anxiety, and depression. Over time, chronic sleep deprivation can lead to more severe mental health issues. Ensuring adequate rest is essential for maintaining emotional balance and mental clarity.

                    <h2 className={articleH2}>The Stages of Sleep</h2>
                    <h3 className={articleH3}>REM vs. Non-REM Sleep</h3>
                    <p className={articleP}>
                        Sleep is not a uniform state; it consists of several stages that cycle throughout the night. The two main types of sleep are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep and Non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep includes stages of light sleep, deep sleep, and slow-wave sleep, which are critical for physical restoration. REM sleep, on the other hand, is associated with vivid dreaming and plays a key role in memory consolidation and emotional processing.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className={articleH3}>The Sleep Cycle</h3>
                    <p className={articleP}>
                        A full sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes and includes both Non-REM and REM sleep stages. Throughout the night, these cycles repeat, with REM periods becoming longer as the night progresses. Interruptions to this cycle can lead to feelings of grogginess and reduced cognitive function. Understanding the sleep cycle is important for optimizing rest and ensuring we wake up feeling refreshed.

                    <h3 className={articleH3}>Establishing a Sleep Routine</h3>
                    <p className={articleP}>
                        One of the most effective ways to improve sleep is by establishing a consistent sleep routine. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate the body’s internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up naturally. Incorporating relaxing activities, such as reading or taking a warm bath before bed, can signal to your body that it’s time to wind down.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className={articleH3}>Creating a Sleep-Friendly Environment</h3>
                    <p className={articleP}>
                        The environment in which you sleep can have a significant impact on the quality of your rest. Aim to create a sleep-friendly environment by keeping your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine to minimize disruptions. Additionally, investing in a comfortable mattress and pillows can make a big difference in how well you sleep.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className={articleH3}>Limiting Screen Time</h3>
                    <p className={articleP}>
                        Exposure to screens before bed can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. The blue light emitted by phones, tablets, and computers suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. To improve sleep quality, try to limit screen time in the hour leading up to bed. Instead, opt for activities that promote relaxation, such as meditation or journaling.
